            <p class="person">JAMES MICHAEL B. PATACSIL | 21 YEARS OLD</p>
            <p class="desc">Hi. I'm an IT student who likes playing the piano, playing games, and cosplaying, and more. I was born on the 12th of May and I like Star Wars. I love drawing, especially when it's digital art. I don't live with my mother and my father is long gone, so I like getting income through things I like to help support myself, such as making digital art commissions or doing developer work with family members.</p>
